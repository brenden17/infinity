Fermat's last theorem

I read a Permat's last theorem this weekend. 
It is not so difficult to figure out the main idea of proof(but I can not understand any fomular at all) because I already the read it around 6 years ago.This time I found out a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hkz45Ivr12k) related to this book on Youtube and interviewing wiht Andrew Wiles touched me deeply.
I tried to look for his recent work but I could not. As his personality, he might surprise us again soon.
