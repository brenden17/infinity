Easy to create presentation with pydown

Sometimes I don't want waste my time to make presentation which is not so important. At the first stage, I want to focus on the contents, do not care about font'size, font style etc.

Today I checked out [pydown](http://github.com/isnowfy/pwdown)

[sourcecode language="python"]
pip install python-pydown
[/sourcecode]

and then edit slide.md.

[sourcecode language="python"]
!SLIDE

# Hello

!SLIDE

# Another slide

!SLIDE left

# left
[/sourcecode]

lastly, generate it. That's all.

[sourcecode language="python"]
pydwon slide.md slides
[/sourcecode]
