Speed up with readlines

You might get the idea as you compare between readline and readlines. 
It might make your code speed up more 3 times.

[sourcecode language="python"]
with open(filename) as f:
    while True:
        lines = f.readlines(1000) #buffer size
        if not lines:
            break
        for line in lines:
            #code
[/sourcecode]
